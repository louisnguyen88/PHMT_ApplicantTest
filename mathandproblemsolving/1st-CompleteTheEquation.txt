To determine the missing part of the equation, let’s analyze the pattern in the equation provided:

1. The first part of the equation adds up all single values:
(1)+(2)+(3)+(4)

2. The second part of the equation subtracts all pairwise products:
−(1×2)−(1×3)−(1×4)−(2×3)−(2×4)−(3×4)

3. Following this pattern, the missing part should involve adding up all possible products of three numbers at a time:
+(1×2×3)+(1×2×4)+(1×3×4)+(2×3×4)

4. Finally, the equation subtracts the product of all four numbers:
−(1×2×3×4)

Completed Equation
The completed equation is:
(1)+(2)+(3)+(4)−(1×2)−(1×3)−(1×4)−(2×3)−(2×4)−(3×4)+(1×2×3)+(1×2×4)+(1×3×4)+(2×3×4)−(1×2×3×4)

This matches the observed pattern of alternating addition and subtraction across different combinations of the numbers.
